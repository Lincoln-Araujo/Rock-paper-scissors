:memo:**DESCRIPTION:** 
<p>
    This is a simple rock, paper and scissors game made in javascript and its purpose is to integrate some knowledge in programming logic. 
    How this game have a rule that the player must win 5 rounds to be the champion, making a loop was little challenge because 'while' is a kind of loop really annoying if you do not know how to make the loop stops. In the end, I could find a way to use 'while' with some 'ifs' to prevent input errors.
